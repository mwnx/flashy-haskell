Flashy-Haskell
==============
> Adds detail to haskell's default syntax in vim; lets you get... flashy...

Flashy-Haskell is an extension to the Haskell syntax provided by default
with the vim distribution. It matches more complex structures than just
simple keywords, enabling a wider variety of colourings. For instance, it
matches whole `data`, `class`, or function blocks, and is thus capable of
enabling folds for functions as well.

It also comes with its own colour scheme that can be loaded by adding this
line to your vimrc:
> colorscheme flashy-haskell-dark
(for now, only works on dark themed 256 colour terminals)

But enough talking, let's take a look at what we've got:
